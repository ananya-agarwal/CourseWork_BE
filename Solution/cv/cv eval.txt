Haar Cascade Classifiers in opencv (face detection ): We will implement our use case using the Haar Cascade classifier.
 Haar Cascade classifier is an effective object detection approach which was proposed by Paul Viola and Michael Jones in their paper, “Rapid Object Detection using a
 Boosted Cascade of Simple Features” in 2001.

classifier: 
"Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Neural Network": MTCNN is mainly based on 3 separate CNN models: P-Net, R-Net and O-Net. 
The name of the P-Net comes from proposal network. 
It looks for face in 12×12 sized frames. The mission of this network is to produce fast results. The name of R-Net comes from refine network.
app: used for face detection.
